## Overview
DroneFlight is a web application designed to display and edit KMZ files as 3D images directly within the application. This eliminates the need for users to download files to their computers, providing a seamless experience for viewing and editing 3D models.

## Features
- Display KMZ files as interactive 3D images.
- Edit 3D images in real-time.
- User-friendly interface for managing KMZ files.
